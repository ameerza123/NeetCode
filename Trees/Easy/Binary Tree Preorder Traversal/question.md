You are given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,2,4,5,3,6,7]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,5,null]
Output: [1,2,4,3,5]

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Constraints:
0 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
