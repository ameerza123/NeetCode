# Solution 1

I initially misunderstood the task and thought the question was asking about palindromes.
Thankfully I realized my mistake relatively early on.

Reading the hints suggested the use of a HashMap so I decided to use one too.

Initial thoughts:
- If arrays are different lengths, return false
- One hash map for each string
- Containing each char and the frequency it appears in the string

Looking at the solution I saw a much shorter solution.
The solution was not easy to understand just from reading so I thought to expand it.
