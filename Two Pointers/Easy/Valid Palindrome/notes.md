# Initial Thoughts

- Use two pointers to go from start and end of the string.
- Use a helper function to check for alphanumeracy

# Solution 1

Took some time to figure out how to get the pointers to correctly skip any non alpha numeric in a for loop.
Eventually I peaked at the solution and saw they were using a while loop.
