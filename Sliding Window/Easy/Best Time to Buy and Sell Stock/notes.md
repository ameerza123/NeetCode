# Initial Thoughts

After struggling for some time to find a better solution than just brute forcing, I decided to read some of the hints.
The hint suggested focusing on the sell day, and looking at the buy days that come before it to find the max profit.

# Solution 1

After coming up with my solution I looked at the given solutions. I noticed they're using pointers and while loops
instead of for loops (like in the solution for Valid Palindrome). I assume that is the better way to do it.
