# NeetCode Python Solutions
An in-progress repository designed to store my solutions and notes in reference to the Python solutions for NeetCode's 250 problem set.

## Why NeetCode's 250 problem set?
I chose to focus on this specific problem set, as opposed to something like LeetCode, as it was a free and intuitive resource perfect for sharpening up my skills on a wide range of typical DSA problems. Ultimately, it is a preference thing as all similar platforms and problem sets will feature the same problem categories.

## Why Python?
Although I have more experience programming in Java, I decided to write up my solutions in Python due to its general efficiency, which is perfect for timed problems in interviews.
